# New Packet Radio

   This is the source code for the NPR-70 modem firmware by F4HDK.

   This code is based on the 2020_02_23 release available at https://hackaday.io/project/164092-npr-new-packet-radio .

   It adds a couple of features such as SNMP support (see the included MIB), as well as a refactor of settings (which makes it possible to update settings across firmware releases if needed) and reduced memory usage.
